## Thrust Washers

There's not much to mention for the thrust washers since they prevent the crank from walking and there's no reason not to use the OEM range.

The GSR and CRV allow similar amounts of crank end play (lol) with the GSR allowing up to .0008" and the CRV allowing up to .001".

[Be sure to give this a quick check to make sure your motor is all good](https://www.k1technologies.com/k1-blog/how-to-check-crankshaft-end-play/) and also double check that you don't install your thrust washers backwards.

TODO: Mention cheap dial indicator I bought and what my specs were.

## Summary

All in all I think these bearing clearances look great. Now that OEM bearings have gotten hard to source with various colors being discontinued it can be harder to really dial in your clearances but it's definitely still doable.

The next part will be over P2W clearance and ring gaps. Stay tuned!
