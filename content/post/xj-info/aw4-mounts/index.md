There's two different versions of the transmission mount for XJs that came with the AW4 automatic transmission and they're commonly referred to as centered, and offset.

The offset mount (top one in picture above) can be found in 1999 and older XJs. The centered mount (bottom one) can be found in 2000 or 2001 XJs. The main difference between the mounts is how they attach to the crossmember due to different bolt hole locations.

## FAQs

**Is there a difference in mounts between the 4.0L (i6) and 2.5L (i4)?**

No difference, because they both share the same transmission.

**Could I use a centered mount if my XJ had an offset mount, or vice versa?**

It depends. Some XJs only have 4 bolt holes on the crossmember whereas others have 8. If your crossmember has 8 bolt holes then you can pick or choose between the two styles of mounts. If your crossmember only has 4 bolt holes then you must use the same style mount that came with your XJ.
