Enough measuring for now, it's time to do some assembly and get the crank, pistons, and rods installed. Overall assembly of the bottom end isn't super complicated, but it's important to be careful while assembling everything.

## Installing the Crank

First up is the crank. Before proceeding you'll want to make sure the crank and block are as clean as possible.

(The numbers on my block are the bolt torque sequence because I kept messing up the order)

With the block and crank is as clean as possible you can go ahead and pop the bearing halves in. If you're using OEM bearings make sure you match each one to the correct journal. I'm using ACL bearings and they should all be the same size but out of precaution I put each one back in the same journal I measured bearing clearance for.

Then each bearing was given a coating of assembly lube, the crank was carefully lowered into position and the thrust washers were pushed into place. 

Note: Make sure you don't install the thrust washers backwards! The slots on them should be facing out towards the crank. An easy way to verify they are correct is if the chamfered edge on each end is facing the crank.

Then all that's left is to install the other bearing halves into the main journals, coat in assembly lube, and torque down the main caps. Proper torque sequence is available here, or can be found in the CRV FSM.

Make sure each main cap is installed in the correct spot as they are numbered and also make sure the crank can spin freely. If you're not able to rotate the crank by hand you'll need to take things apart and figure out what went wrong before moving forward.

If the crank does spin freely you can proceed with installing the rear main seal and oil pump.

## Attaching the Pistons to the Rods

There's a lot of easy to make mistakes that can lead to trouble during assembly. Small things like mixing up a piston and installing it in the wrong cylinder causing your P2W to be off, or forgetting to torque a rod bolt.

- TODO: Installing the rods
  - Explain the difference between press pin and free floating
    - https://info.jepistons.com/wrist-pin-locks-different-types-and-how-to-install-them
  - Link to video on how to install clips 
  - Ensure pistons are oriented so intake valves are on the opposite side of the bearing tang
    - Not every aftermarket piston has an arrow pointing to the crank pulley like the OEM ones so this is next best
    - Intake valves are the larger valve

## Popping the Piston Rings On

- TODO: Installing the rings
  - Add diagram of side profiles from FSM
  - Explain that you can tell the top of the ring by a marking (show image 4)
  - This only applies to top and 2nd ring. Oil rings don't really have an up / down

## Installing the Pistons Into Their Cylinders

- TODO: Install pistons / rods in block
  - Mention tools needed
    - Expensive ones are super nice but cheap ones can be good enough for a hobbyist
    - Install piston 1 / 4 or 2 / 3 first then rotate crank and do other two
    - Ensure crank can freely spin after each rod is installed to ensure no binding
    - Make sure your pistons are oriented correctly. This means intake valves on backside of motor and bearing tangs on front
    - Don't forget thread lubricant if required

## Checking For Rod End Play and Crank Play

- TODO: Checking rod play and crank play
  - Crank play requires a dial indicator to check
  - Mention allowance
  - Mention what I got (.004")
  - Rod play requires a set of feeler gauges. Can be cheapos
  - Mention my results (rod 1: .011", rod 2: .012", rod 3: .012", rod 4: .012")

## Bolting On the Last Few Bottom End Bits

- TODO: Finishing it up
  - Install baffle
  - Install oil pump pickup
    - Make sure it's clean inside
    - Don't forget the pickup tube gasket
  - Install oil pan
