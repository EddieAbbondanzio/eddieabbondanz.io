My name's Ed Abbondanzio, and as you've probably already figured out this is my personal blog. I'm a full stack developer who loves to build things. I graduated from the University of Maine in Orono in 2018 with a bachelors of science in computer science.

Other hobbies of mine include working on my vehicles, and slowly learning how to play a synthesizer.

My most recent car project was cutting out the rotted rear floor / unibody frame from my Jeep Cherokee and replacing it with all new pieces that I fabricated.

I can happily report my Jeep is currently back on the road, and running great.

And before that I was restoring an old Honda Civic with a new paint job, rust repair, motor swap, and converting it from an automatic to manual transmission.
