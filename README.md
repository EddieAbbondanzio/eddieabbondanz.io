My personal blog that I make an attempt to post to on a regular basis. Topics will include anything from software architecture, patterns, tutorials, and more. Occasionally I like to post updates on my vehicles as I work on them as well.

## Why run a blog?

I'm a firm believer that everybody should manage their own blog. Everybody has something to offer, and sharing our accomplishments, knowledge, or struggles helps encourage others. Everyone started off as a beginner, and without help from others, none of us would be where we are today. ["A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle"](http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2017/8/4/a-candle-loses-nothing-by-lighting-another-candle) is a great principle to follow because in the end being selfish or condescending doesn't help you in any way.

## Why Not Just Use an Existing Social Media Platform?

By running your own blog you have full control. No one is siphoning off any data they can possibly squeeze out of you, and no one is moderating your content. There's no restrictions on how the blog looks, and it can be satisfying to say that you run your own site.

## How Do I Start?

It doesn't take much work to get a blog up and running. For a basic set up of a static site (which is more than sufficient for a blog) you'll just need a domain. If you host the files on GitHub Pages like this one is, then you won't have to pay anything in hosting fees. 

## Registering a Domain

You'll need to register your domain through a registrar. I'd recommend avoiding GoDaddy due to their stance against Net Neutrality, and shady business practices. Better options are:

* [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en)
* [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

## Building the Blog

You'll want to use a static site generator. There's plenty of options out there depending on what languages you prefer. Even though I have very little GoLang experience, I like to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as it's not overly complex. A few worthy methions are:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

Most static site generators will offer free themes that were developed by the community. Pick the one you like the most that helps convey the right mood for your site and tweak it to your hearts desire.

## Start Writing

Write about anything that interest you. Write about something you've just learned and want to share. Write about the project your working on. It's your blog, and your in control, so don't be afraid.
