My name's Eddie Abbondanzio, and as you've probably already figured out this is my personal blog. Most of my posts will be technical writeups on projects I've completed but occasionally I'll thrown in some humorous content.

Career wise I'm a software engineer and before that I was an auto detailer (ran my own business along with several years of working as one).

I pretty much enjoy any job that lets me get hands on experience.

Some of my hobbies include fixing up my own vehicles, welding and metal fabrication, learning how to play a synthesizer, and attempting to get better at auto cross.
