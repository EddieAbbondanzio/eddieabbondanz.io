The fog lights were a little too squarish for my taste so I made some custom overlays to give them a slight "curve". The grill is also the custom debadged one I made a couple months back.

On the newer RLs they came with paint matched side skirts. I decided I want them as well.

Not bad for spray paint. This was after hitting them with a buff.

I also made another custom debadged grill. I felt the car looked better with a little more chrome on the front. I really like the lack of badging.
