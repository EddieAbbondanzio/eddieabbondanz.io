# How to use

1. Select your tire size
2. Enter your car's red line.
3. Select your transmissions code.
4. Select the chassis that your transmission came out of\*\*
5. Adjust gear ratios / final drive as desired.

\*\*You can't rely on just the transmission code because Honda re-used them for multiple transmissions. For example an S80 trans could be anything from an LS to a GSR.
