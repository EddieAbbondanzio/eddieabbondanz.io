Made a little more progress on the tablet. I'm using a Nexus 7 Gen 2 tablet.

I had to open up the tablet to solder in wires to the power button. Other than that everything is 100% stock.

Installed. I was hoping to match the bezel closer to the radio but it was pretty hard finding the right black.

I love the color that the projectors give off. That and the custom lighting in the cluster is a how upgrade over the stock setup.

The color of the cut off is visible whenever I drive around.
