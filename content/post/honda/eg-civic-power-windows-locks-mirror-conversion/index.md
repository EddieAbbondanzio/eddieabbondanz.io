Converting an EG Civic from manual to power windows, locks, and mirrors by building your own wiring harnesses is a moderately challenging task as it'll require you to pull the dash, remove your fenders, dig into the main cabin harness, and get overly familiar with the wiring of the car, but it's definitely doable and the results are well worth it.

![](images/1.jpg)

If doing all of the above sounds daunting to you, there are easier options such as sourcing all the OEM harnesses you'd need (EX cabin harness, and both power door harnesses) and then just swapping the electrical harnesses into your car along with the power door guts but it's getting harder and harder to source the harnesses now so that may not be feasible.

# Background

My Civic is a 93 DX hatch and the only features it originally came with from the factory were power steering, and AC. That meant it had manual everything in the interior including crank windows, manual locks, and manual mirrors.

Since it no longer has AC I really wanted to add power windows to compensate because it can be pretty obnoxious trying to roll up or down the passenger window while driving. Adding power mirrors and locks was just the cherry on top.

# Supplies Needed

**Heads up this DIY is for coupes and hatchbacks only!** Sedans require different parts and also have different pinouts for the front window switches so this DIY will not work for sedans.

Coupes and hatchbacks share the same parts for the doors so parts can safely be interchanged between them.

- Driver and passenger power door panels
- Driver and passenger window switches
- Driver and passenger window regulators
- Driver and passenger lock actuators
- Driver and passenger power mirrors
- Driver and passenger power mirror interior covers (the little triangle panels on the inside of the door)
- Power mirror switch for the dash
- Power lock control unit (38380-SR3-A01)
- Power window relay (Denso 056700-7250 plugs into the dash fusebox)
- 14, 16, 18, and 20 AWG wire. I bought mine from Waytek, but there's plenty of other options.
- Lots of heat-shrink. Size will vary based on your wire insulation but I used 0.09" ID, 0.13" ID, and 0.19" ID.
- A couple 20 amp fuses

## Tips

- Try to source components with electrical pigtails (if buying used ones). This saves you from having to hunt down connectors to use for your wiring harness. If not, most of them are [Sumitomo HD 090 connectors](https://www.corsa-technic.com/category.php?category_id=172) and can be bought new.
- If you want to repin the old connectors [these](https://www.corsa-technic.com/item.php?item_id=521) will work on almost all of the connectors (except the power mirrors)
- Not every power driver door has the lock switch cutout so if you want to add power locks be careful when sourcing your driver door panel.
- Coupe window switches are hard to source. They're also notorious for cracking around the mounting bolt hole so double check them before buying them.
- If you can't source power lock assemblies for both doors you can buy just the actuators and install them on your manual lock assemblies.

## Other Good Stuff to Have

This will come down to your preferences, but the wiring ran through the door jambs need to be protected, and you'll also need some kind of connectors to hook up the door harnesses. I used the following:

- (2) EG or EK power door grommets (cabin side)
- [(2) Smaller grommets (for door side)](https://ceautoelectricsupply.com/product/firewall-grommets/)
- [(2) Rubber door loom thingies](https://www.johnnylawmotors.com/catalog/frame-body-parts/shaved-doors/shaved-door-accessories/KICDLOOM/rubber-door-loom)
- (2) [Sumitomo HD-090-14P](https://www.corsa-technic.com/item.php?item_id=743&category_id=174) and [Sumitomo HD-090-14S](https://www.corsa-technic.com/item.php?item_id=744) for the DIY door harnesses to connect to the cabin harness

The EG / EK grommets look like this:

Manual door grommets won't work because they have a smaller ID and there's not enough space to run all the wiring through them.

# Getting Started: Swap the Door Guts

- Swap door guts / mirrors
- Can use manual locks with power actuator. THey have the mounting holes for the actuator
- Easiest to remove the window
- Make sure you adjust your window guides properly

# OLD BELOW!

# Wiring

FLESH OUT MORE

- Will likely need to pull the dash
- Will need to remove fenders
- Best option is to open up your main harness so you can run your wires inside it. Or simply run it as a secondary harness
- Start with passenger door it's easier
- Then driver door
- Lastly make the cabin harness wiring
- Install fuses! Install relay

# Troubleshooting

- If your windows don't work at first, double check the fuses. Then double check you installed the power window relay otherwise the fuses won't be getting any power.
- If your windows struggle to move up or down, check that the window guides are properly adjusted. If that doesn't help double check you have the helper spring on the regulator. One of my power regulators didn't come with one so I swapped one of the springs from my manual regulator but turns out I had it backwards so the power window would only go up halfway because it was fighting the spring.
- If lock actuators work backwards, try flipping the wires on one of them.
- If the lock actuators unlock but then relock right after you may have one of them wired backwards.
- If your power mirrors are acting weird, double check the wiring at the switch
  - The horizontal adjustment for mine wasn't working properly as it was moving both mirrors when I adjusted them left or right. Turns out I had wires 3 / 4 on the switch crossed and flipping them fixed the issue.

# References

The information is pretty redundant between the two but I found the eletrical troubleshooting manual to be more indepth as it even included photos of connector locations, and was easier to navigate since it's less bulky than the factory service manual.

## Connectors

I bought a lot of my components used and cleaned them up because I was able to buy them with pigtail connectors. This made building the harness a lot easier since I didn't have to source as many connectors.

With that said I haven't been able to find anyone still selling the OEM door connectors.

# Prep

- Remove fenders
- Remove door panels
- Remove dash
- Remove HVAC, remove firewall sound deadeing
- Lube up window regulators if you bought used, consider buying new window motors before installing
- - Ensure helper spring is installed.

# Swapping the door guts

- Window regulators
  - Explain how to test windows
  - Explain how to adjust regulator via the bolts / window channel
- Door locks
- Mirrors

# Adding the Missing fuses

- Power window relay
- Bunch o 20amp fuses

# Building the Harness

### C555

- Will need to source a connector for C555 as it'll be missing. This plugs into the backside of the fuse box
  - Show photo of the connector
  - Part #
  - Where it plugs into

TODO: Add picture of where the connector goes, and where it looks

### C502

This is the 12 pin blue connector above the fuse box. Every Civic has it since it's used for passing wires from the dash to rear wire harness.

We need to tap into the back side of the connector so we can grab the driver speaker + and -.

There's already going to be wires back there so we can either remove them and set them aside to avoid hacking up the OEM harness. They run to the original driver door harness connector that's only two wires

TODO: Add picture of connector, and pins we want

TODO: I'm thinking I'd like to add a 2pin connector that grabs these. Then I can disconnect the power harness anytime

### C436

This is the 14 pin gray connector above the fuse box. Like C502 every civic has it since it's used for the dash harness. We need to tap into the backside of this connector so we grab the passenger speaker + and 1. There's also going to be wires in these pins but we can de-pin them since we'll be running our own wires.

TODO: Add picture of connector, and pins we want

TODO: I'm thinking I'd like to add a 2pin connector that grabs these. Then I can disconnect the power harness anytime

### C558

This is power mirror switch.

TODO: Show picture!

### G552

This isn't a connector! It's a ground! Wow! It's just a screw that goes into the driver side pillar. Can use some O ring connectors that work with m6 bolts.

We'll be running two wires here so it's easy to send one into the driver door, and one into the passenger door.

### THe DIY Harness

THe harness won't have too many connectors to add.

- 2 wires from C502 (optional 2 pin connector to tap into them)
- 2 wires from C436 (optional 2 pin connector to tap into them)
- New connector for C555 with 4 wires
- Power switch connector
- 2 16 pin Molex for the door harness connectors
