## Finishing things up

With the weather warming up it's been making me miss the civic quite a bit. While it may not be the fastest car out there I do enjoy riving it. I had the chance to work on it a bit more this weekend. To get myself motivated I started by getting the radiator mounted in place. After that I wired up the charge harness.

I had thought this task would be difficult but it really wasn't that bad. Since the baterry is in the bumper I ran the wires through the fender to hide everything.

I ended up re-using the air intake set up I had on the mini-me. Turns out the throttle body is larger so the intake is restricting it but it's only temporary.

Nice overshot

With the charge system all done I was finally able to put a fender back on.

It looks like a car again!

I finished up the driver side and was able to put every body panel back on it.

Nice overshot. Really happy to see it coming back together.
