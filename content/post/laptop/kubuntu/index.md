I've been using Windows for as long as I can remember. Back when Windows 2000 was a big deal I remember using it to play Space Cadet pinball although I was never very good at it.

With the rise of Windows 10 it feels as if Microsoft is going downhill and no longer gives you "full control" of your own computer. My biggest gripe with Windows 10 is the automatic updates that it forces upon you.

I'd been on the fence about jumping over to Linux for some time, but was always hesistant because I didn't quite like the UI of Ubuntu. Then I came across this [post](https://dev.to/uf4no/my-kubuntu-osx-look-alike-desktop-setup-219g) on Dev.to. Until then I had never realized how customizable Linux was and finally decided it was time to take the plunge.

It didn't take long to prepare my laptop for the switch. I moved my documents, pictures, and more over to the secondary hard drive then prepared a live USB for Kubuntu. It took a few installs due to messing up the hard drive set up but eventually I figured it out and am officially a happy Linux user.

Kubuntu offers some nice features such as virtual desktops, full customization, and best of all doesn't randomly decide it's okay to kick off an update just because the laptop's gone idle for 15 minutes and closes out everything you had open.
