With the bearing clearances dialed in, all that's left to prep for installing the crank, pistons, and rods in the block is double checking the piston to wall clearance and setting the ring gaps.

## Piston To Wall Clearance

Piston to wall clearance (aka p2w) is how much space there is between the piston and cylinder wall. P2W is important because too little clearance and your pistons could contact the cylinder wall when the engine is running which will ruin the cylinders, and too much clearance can result in piston slap when the engine is first started up that can lead to premature wear.

Setting piston to wall clearance is difficult because the only way to change it is typically via machining and you need to have your pistons picked out before you can even measure it.

But before buying your pistons you should either have your machine shop check the cylinders to ensure they are within the service range and are still in round, [or check them yourself using a 3 - 4" micrometer and a dial bore gauge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXiN1lNZ7TY). If your cylinders are out of round or beyond the factory allowed service range you'll need to have them bored out otherwise you'll never be able to properly set p2w.

For a B20, the standard cylinder range is 84mm - 84.02mm (3.307" - 3.308") with a service limit of 84.07mm (3.310").

## The Ideal P2W Depends On Your Build

There's several factors to consider when deciding what the ideal p2w for your build is and unless your running factory pistons in the factory bore you shouldn't stick with the factory range.

High Level:

- Explain what piston to wall is and why it's important
  - Too loose, pistons slap. Too tight pistons contact cylinder wall and game over
- Mention that the ideal p2w depends on your build
  - Factors like block material, piston material, forged vs cast, power level, etc...
  - Can really only set p2w if you've had the block bored and gave the pistons to the machine shop

## How to Measure P2W

Steps:

- Measure piston diameters with micrometer
- Zero out your dial bore gauge to the micrometer
- Measure difference in cylinder
- Add some good reference videos
- Mention my measurements and explain why I'm happy with them.
