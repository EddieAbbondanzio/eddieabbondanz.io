My name's Eddie Abbondanzio, and as you've probably already figured out this is my personal blog. Most of my posts will be technical writeups on projects I've completed but occasionally I'll thrown in some humorous content.

Career wise I'm a software engineer with 3 years experience in the industry. Outside of software I have about 7 years of experience working as an auto detailer.

My primary hobbies include restoring my vehicles, anything relating to metal fabrication / building things, slowly learning how to play a synthesizer, and delving into the world of autocross.

If you'd like to chat feel free to shoot me an email: hello@eddieabbondanzio.com

I might not always reply right away.
