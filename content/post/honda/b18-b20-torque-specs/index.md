The ultimate list of torque specs for B18A1, B18B1, B20B, B20Z2 engines. I made this list because I was tired of digging through the 94-01 Integra and 97 - 02 CRV factory service manuals to find them all.

**Note**: VTEC engines (B16A, B18C1, B18C5, etc...) have different specs and shouldn't use this list!
