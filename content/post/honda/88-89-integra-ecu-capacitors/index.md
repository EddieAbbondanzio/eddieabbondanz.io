There's only 6 capacitors in the 1988 - 1989 Integra ECU but getting to them can be a pain since the ECU is hidden underneath the passenger seat. The parts list required is as follows:

- (3x) 35v 33uf capacitors. OEM is .175" diameter
- (1x) 35v 330uf capacitor. OEM is .360" diameter
- (1x) 10v 470uf capacitor. OEM is .280" diameter
- (1x) 16v 100uf capacitor. OEM is .225" diameter

# Tips for picking out capacitors

I'm by no means an expert when it comes to electrical components but here's some tips:

- They should be aluminum-electrolytic, surface mount, radial cap.
- Try to find ones that are AEC-Q200 rated with a long life span (2,000+ hours)
- Try to find replacements that match the OEM diameter or are smaller to avoid fitment issues.
- Voltage can be higher, but uF should always be the same.

# Notes

The 1986 - 1987 Integra uses a different ECU as the earlier years had a vacuum based ignition advanced timing setup where as the later years (88 - 89) used an electrical setup. I do not know if this list will work for an 86 or 87 as my Integra is an 88 so please double check before ordering if you have an earlier model.
